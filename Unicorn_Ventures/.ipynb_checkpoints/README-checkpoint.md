<h1>Time Series</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A series of data points collected in time order is known as a time series. Most of business houses work on time series data to analyze sales number for the next year, website traffic, count of traffic, number of calls received, etc. Data of a time series can be used for forecasting.</p>

<p>Some of the examples of time series are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stock Prices</li>
    <li>Passenger Count of an airlines</li>
    <li>Temperature over time</li>
    <li>Number of visitors in a hotel</li>
</ul>
<p>Now as we have an understanding of what a time series is and the difference between a time series and a non time series, let’s now look at the components of a time series.</p>

<h2>Components of Time Series</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Trend</li>
    <p>Trend is a general direction in which something is developing or changing.</p>
    <li>Seasonality</li>
    <p> Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a specific time period can be said to be seasonality.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Difference between a time series and regression problem</h3>
<p>Here you might think that as the target variable is numerical it can be predicted using regression techniques, but a time series problem is different from a regression problem in following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The main difference is that a time series is time dependent. So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesn’t hold in this case.</li>
    <li>Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most Time Series have some form of seasonality trends,i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, predicting a time series using regression techniques is not a good approach.</p>

<p><b><i>Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.</i></b></p>
